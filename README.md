## Frog Jump Buffer

### Description

`frog-jump-buffer` is the fastest buffer-jumping Emacs lisp package
around. It is the spiritual successor to
[`ace-jump-buffer`](https://github.com/waymondo/ace-jump-buffer) and is
powered by [`avy`](https://github.com/abo-abo/avy) via
[`frog-menu`](https://github.com/clemera/frog-menu). Just like
`ace-jump-buffer`, it allows you to hop to any Emacs buffer in 2-3 key
strokes.

### Installation

You can install it from [MELPA](http://melpa.org/) with `M-x package-install` or here’s a basic `use-package` declaration:

```emacs-lisp
(use-package frog-jump-buffer :ensure t)
```

### Usage

#### `(frog-jump-buffer)`

This is the main entry-point. Bind it to your preferred key-binding.

It opens the `frog-menu` buffer selector. The buffers appear in order
of most recent display or selection.

Selecting the `avy` character next to a buffer switches to that
buffer.

Use `0` to toggle between opening in the same window or
`(other-window)`.

The numbers `1` through `6` will cycle through the default buffer filters:

- `1`: show all buffers in the `(buffer-list)`
- `2`: filter buffers to the same mode as `current-buffer`
- `3`: filter buffers to only buffers represented by files
- `4`: show buffers from `recentf`, which can include killed buffers
- `5`: filter buffers to the same project as `current-buffer` (requires
  [`projectiile`](https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile) to be installed)
- `6`: filter buffers to similarly named buffers. (i.e. if `(current-buffer)` is `frog.html`, show
  `frog.css`, `*magit: frog*`, etc.)

### Variables

#### `frog-jump-buffer-ignore-buffers`

This is a list of regexps of buffer names to ignore or buffer-matching
filter functions to use. If you want to cut down on the noise of unimportant buffers, you will
want to configure this. Here’s an example:

```emacs-lisp
(dolist (regexp '("TAGS" "^\\*Compile-log" "-debug\\*$" "^\\:" "errors\\*$" "^\\*Backtrace" "-ls\\*$"
                  "stderr\\*$" "^\\*Flymake" "^\\*vc" "^\\*Warnings" "^\\*eldoc" "\\^*Shell Command"))
    (push regexp frog-jump-buffer-ignore-buffers))
```

#### `frog-jump-buffer-max-buffers`

This is the maximum number of buffers to show in the `frog-menu`. The
default is 12.

#### `frog-jump-buffer-default-filter`

This is the default filter to use when invoking `frog-jump-buffer`. Shows all buffers by default. If
you would like to include recently killed buffers by default, you might want to set this to
`frog-jump-buffer-filter-recentf`.

#### `frog-jump-buffer-include-current-buffer`

Set to `nil` to remove the current buffer from always being the first menu option. This is handy if
you would prefer `ESC` to be your menu dismissal command.

#### `frog-jump-buffer-posframe-parameters`

Explicit frame parameters to be used by the posframe `frog-jump-buffer` creates.

#### `frog-jump-buffer-posframe-handler`

The posframe handler that `frog-jump-buffer` should use. Defaults to `(point)` being the bottom left
point of the posframe.

#### `frog-jump-buffer-default-filters-capital-letters`

Set to a non-nil value to use capital letters instead of numbers for the default filter actions
instead of numbers.

#### `frog-jump-buffer-use-default-filter-actions`

Set to `nil` to only use the filter actions defined in `frog-jump-buffer-filter-actions`.

#### `frog-jump-buffer-filter-actions`

This is an empty list available for adding user defined buffer filter actions to be available during
`frog-jump-buffer`.

### Custom Filter Actions

You can add your own custom filter actions. Each action is a list of the form `(KEY DESCRIPTION FILTER-FUNCTION)`. Each filter function receives a buffer as an argument and should return a non-nil
value if that buffer should be considered display-worthy in `frog-menu-buffer`.

Example usage:

```emacs-lisp
(defun frog-jump-buffer-filter-special-buffers (buffer)
  (with-current-buffer buffer
    (-any? #'derived-mode-p '(comint-mode magit-mode inf-ruby-mode rg-mode compilation-mode))))

(setq frog-jump-buffer-filter-actions
 '(("7" "[special]" frog-jump-buffer-filter-special-buffers)))
```

If you would like to call a function that uses a specific filter
function by default, you can do so by defining a function like this:

```emacs-lisp
(defun frog-jump-buffer-same-project ()
  (interactive)
  (let ((frog-jump-buffer-current-filter-function #'frog-jump-buffer-filter-same-project))
    (frog-jump-buffer)))
```

See `frog-menu-buffer.el` for more details.

### all-the-icons-ivy integration

When all-the-icons-ivy is available, an icon (which represents the
file type) will be inserted in front of the buffer name, such that it
is easier to spot the desired buffer to jump to. Here is a screenshot:
