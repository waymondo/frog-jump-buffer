;;; Commentary:

;; `frog-jump-buffer' allows you to hop to any Emacs buffer in 2-3 key strokes.

;; `(frog-jump-buffer)' is the main entry-point.  Bind it to your preferred key-binding.

;; It opens the `frog-menu' buffer selector.  The buffers appear in order
;; of most recent display or selection.

;; Selecting the `avy' character next to a buffer switches to that
;; buffer.

;; Use `0' to toggle between opening in the same window or
;; `(other-window)'.

;; The numbers 1 through 6 will cycle through the default buffer filters.
